# Housing Market Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The Housing Market Analysis Dashboard is an interactive web application built using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. This dashboard allows users to visualize and analyze housing market trends based on Zillow's Home Value Index (ZHVI) data for different regions across the United States.

## Development
The dashboard was developed using Python and Dash framework. Here's an overview of the development process:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Raw ZHVI data was collected from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ and preprocessed using Python scripts. This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Jupyter Notebook was used for exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the housing market trends. Visualizations such as line charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots were created to understand correlations and patterns in the data.
- **Dashboard Design**: The Dash framework was used to design and develop the interactive dashboard. Dash provides a Pythonic way to create web applications with rich visualization capabilities. Components such as dropdowns, sliders, and graphs were added to the dashboard to enable user interaction and data visualization.
- **Deployment**: The dashboard was deployed locally for testing and validation. It can also be deployed to cloud platforms such as Heroku or AWS for wider access.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can select regions and time intervals to visualize ZHVI trends using interactive graphs and charts.
- **Filtering**: Dropdown filters allow users to filter data based on state names and region names, enabling focused analysis.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the ZHVI data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the preprocessed data using the provided Jupyter Notebook.
4. **Launch Dashboard**: Run the dashboard application using the provided Python script and access it via a web browser.
